# network Tool
This tool is useful to create a dom0_client that will talk to the dom0 server, send task descriptions and their binaries so that they can be run in the l4 based microkernel.

## File Descriptions
index.js - main entry to the system, does the bootstrapping
dom0_client.js - used to create an instance of the dom0_client. Using this object, all client work can be done via functions.
magic_number.js - communication messages used during the TCP talk.
tasks.xml - the xml file that the application reads by default
debug.js - a very simple debugging wrapper around console logging, so that things can be expanded in the future

## TODO:
- create the tool builder so that we can create elf binaries on the fly

## Sending binaries
the tasks.xml file has a field called as the pkg - which is eventually the binary that is being sent to the L4 system. The binary is placed in the binaries folder and the naming convention is used as [pkg].elf
